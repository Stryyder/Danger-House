# Danger-House
Try to escape a mysterious house (Quick Basic 4.5 circa 1993)
This project is very old, but still runs great on a BASIC engine like QB 4.5

## How to play
There are instructions inside the game to show you how to navigate - including a walkthrough (cheat) if you get stuck


## Future of this project
- Considering updating this to a JavaScript version just for fun and to learn the coding aspects of converting legacy code to something more modern.
- This project used a very precision-based if-statement environment, meaning the player had to type in specific things to move forward in the game.  It would be an interesting project to update using more of a machine-learning mentality, or just a better functionality in terms of what the user has to type in to make things happen.
