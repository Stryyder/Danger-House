# Danger-House
Try to escape a mysterious house (Quick Basic 4.5 circa 1993)
This project is very old, but should still work on a BASIC compiler. 
There are instructions inside the game to show you how to navigate - including a walkthrough (cheat) if you get stuck


## Future of this project
- Considering updating this to a JavaScript version just for fun and to learn the coding aspects of converting legacy code to something more modern.
